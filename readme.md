We draw diagrams to help express our intensions when in discussions, brainstormings or lectures, which makes it easier to understand. But it's difficult to draw a nice, clear diagram like what we make in Keynote or PowerPoint.

TalkingDraw is a whiteboard system to support drawing diagrams (system configuration diagram) at real-time in talking.

It has two mode, free mode for drawing freely and command mode for inserting objects. It supports insert icons, texts, text blocks and links between these objects without disturbing the talking, and editing them convieniently.

It can suggests suitable icons, images from a database according to your speech content and your drawing. For example, if you are explaining a cloud service and draw a cicle gesture on the board, It may suggests icons like "computer" "cloud" "database" and so on. Every icon will have many candidates, like "computer" will contain "desktop computer", "laptop", "computer type A" and so on.

It uses speech recognition, handwriting recognition and seq2seq learning.
